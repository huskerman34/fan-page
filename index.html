            <h2>Why Neverwinter</h2>

            <p>Neverwinter is one of many stories from the Dungeon and Dragons series. I used to play the board game when i was little. I have read some of Drizzit stories from RA Salvatoire and Ed Greenwood. I like the Story line and the game play. Its more action based with less hot keys and the game is free to play. I think my favorite class is the Hunter Ranger. I am a trapper which is mainly support with some damage dealing and better survive ablility. Im up in your face Ranger. </p>
