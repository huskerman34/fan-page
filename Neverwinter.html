<h2>Why Neverwinter</h2>
<p>Neverwinter nights is one of many stories from the world of Dungeon and Dragons. Im an avid fan of Dungeons and Dragons. I used to play the table top game and now I read books by Ed Greenwood and R.A Salvatore. I do play Dungeons and Dragons Online once in a while. Neverwinter gameplay is has more of an arcade feel as there are few hotkeys. The mechanics are great!!!! PVP is also fun. We will follow the trails of a Hunter Ranger, Birdsong Langer.  </p> 
<h2>Birdsong Langer</h2>
<p>Birdsong Langer is a Sun Elf. He is skilled in the Hunter Ranger profession. He is a support fighter. He uses Cordon of Arrows and Foxes Cunning to his disposal.We will observe Birdsong and his companions through there trails and tribulatons as they venture to certain places like</p>
<ul>
    <li>Swordcoast</li>
    <p>Where it all begins as Hunter Ranger. From Hunter to Master Trapper. Take on Orcs, goblins, and the Undead.</p>
    <li>Icewind Dale</li>
    <p> The frozen Tundra. Become a mercenary in for "Arcane Brotherhood" or "Ten Towers"
    </p>
    <li>Tiamat</li>
