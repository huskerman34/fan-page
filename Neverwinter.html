<h2>Why Neverwinter</h2>
<img src="images%20(1).jpg" height="300" width="500" alt="images(1).jpg">
<p>Neverwinter nights is one of many stories from the world of Dungeon and Dragons. Im an avid fan of Dungeons and Dragons. I used to play the table top game and now I read books by Ed Greenwood and R.A Salvatore. I do play Dungeons and Dragons Online once in a while. Neverwinter gameplay is has more of an arcade feel as there are few hotkeys. The mechanics are great!!!! PVP is also fun. We will follow the trails of a Hunter Ranger, Birdsong Langer.  </p>
